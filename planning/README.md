# Migration Summary: Supabase to PocketBase

## Current State Analysis

### Supabase Integration Points Identified:

1. **Dependencies**:

   - `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.49.1
   - Supabase CLI tools

2. **Key Files Using Supabase**:

   - `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Client configuration
   - `src/api/supabase-api.ts` - API abstraction (371 lines)
   - `src/services/SupabaseDataService.ts` - Service implementation (118 lines)
   - `src/store/auth-store.ts` - Authentication store
   - `src/contexts/AppDataContext.tsx` - Data provider switching

3. **Database Schema**:

   - `accounts` table with user relationships
   - `hourly_account_values` for historical tracking
   - `networth_history` for aggregated data
   - Built-in authentication with RLS policies

4. **Authentication Features**:

   - Email/password authentication
   - JWT token management with auto-refresh
   - Session persistence via localStorage
   - OAuth2 configuration (not actively used)

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_USE_SUPABASE` (boolean flag)

## Migration Strategy

### Architecture Preservation

- **DataService Interface**: Maintained unchanged for backward compatibility
- **Service Layer Pattern**: New `PocketbaseDataService` implementing existing interface
- **Dual Mode Support**: Continue supporting demo mode alongside PocketBase

### Key Benefits

1. **Simplified Infrastructure**: Single binary deployment vs cloud services
2. **Cost Reduction**: Eliminate Supabase subscription costs
3. **Enhanced Development**: Faster local setup, embedded database
4. **Real-time Capabilities**: Built-in WebSocket subscriptions
5. **Self-hosting**: Full control over data and deployment

### Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- PocketBase environment setup
- Schema migration to collections
- Basic service implementation
- Authentication foundation

#### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)

- Complete data operations implementation
- Full authentication flow
- Data migration tools
- Comprehensive testing

#### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)

- Real-time features implementation
- Performance optimization
- Production readiness
- Documentation and training

#### Phase 4: Deployment (Weeks 7-8)

- Production deployment
- Gradual user migration
- Cleanup and decommissioning

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Mapping

```
PostgreSQL (Supabase) → SQLite (PocketBase)
- accounts table → accounts collection
- hourly_account_values → account_values collection
- networth_history → networth_history collection
- auth.users → users collection (built-in)
```

### API Compatibility Layer

```typescript
// Existing interface maintained
interface DataService {
  getAccounts(): Promise<AccountWithValue[]>;
  addAccount(account): Promise<AccountWithValue>;
  updateAccount(account): Promise<void>;
  deleteAccount(id): Promise<void>;
  getNetWorthHistory(timeRange): Promise<NetworthHistory[]>;
  getLatestNetWorth(timeRange): Promise<NetWorthSummary>;
  getAccountPerformance(timeRange): Promise<PerformanceData[]>;
}

// New implementation
class PocketbaseDataService implements DataService {
  // Implementation using PocketBase SDK
}
```

### Authentication Migration

- Replace Supabase Auth with PocketBase authentication
- Maintain JWT token patterns
- Preserve session management behavior
- Update auth store for PocketBase user objects

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **Data Migration**: PostgreSQL to SQLite conversion complexity
2. **Performance**: SQLite scalability vs PostgreSQL
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensuring all Supabase features are replicated

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Team Learning Curve**: PocketBase adoption
2. **Deployment Changes**: New infrastructure requirements

### Mitigation Strategies

- Extensive testing at each phase
- Gradual rollout with rollback procedures
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Comprehensive documentation and training

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ API response times ≤ 200ms
- ✅ Test coverage >80%
- ✅ Zero data loss during migration

### Business Metrics

- ✅ Eliminated Supabase subscription costs
- ✅ Reduced deployment complexity
- ✅ Improved developer productivity
- ✅ Enhanced system reliability

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Stakeholder Review**: Present migration plan for approval
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assign team members to migration tasks
3. **Environment Setup**: Begin PocketBase development environment setup

### Phase 1 Kickoff (Week 1)

1. Install and configure PocketBase locally
2. Design collection schemas
3. Begin basic service implementation
4. Set up development documentation

### Key Decisions Required

1. **Timeline Approval**: Confirm 8-week migration schedule
2. **Resource Commitment**: Developer allocation for migration work
3. **Production Strategy**: Deployment infrastructure planning
4. **Migration Window**: Scheduled downtime for data migration

## Conclusion

The migration from Supabase to PocketBase represents a strategic architectural improvement that will:

- **Simplify** infrastructure and reduce operational overhead
- **Reduce** ongoing costs by eliminating cloud service dependencies
- **Enhance** development experience with faster local setup
- **Improve** capabilities with built-in real-time features
- **Maintain** all existing functionality without user impact

The comprehensive planning documents created provide:

- **Migration Plan**: Technical architecture and strategy
- **PRD**: Business requirements and success criteria
- **Task Breakdown**: Detailed implementation timeline

With proper execution following this plan, the migration will be completed successfully within the 8-week timeline while maintaining system reliability and user experience.
